# Simple Search Engine

A general purpose search engine that can parse a `.txt` file to add data and allow users to enter queries to find people who satisfy that query.

## Use

### Entering data
Add any record you want using `text.txt`. Use spaces to delimit features.

### Compile & Run
`javac Simple\ Search\ Engine/task/src/search/Main.java`

`java Main`

### Search
Choose among 3 options:
1. Find a specific person
2. Print all people
3. Exit

If you chose 1, then you can specify a query to match for all records.
You can specify whether you want to return records that match **ALL**, **ANY**, or **NONE** keywords in the query.
